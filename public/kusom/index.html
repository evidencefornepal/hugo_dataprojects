    In today's digital economy, data is the new oil. Data provides valuable
    insights and evidence to make better decisions, be it in business,
    government or the private sector. The newer and better technologies are
    reducing the cost of computational processing and increasing the use of data
    and analytics in a range of disciplines. As such, data literacy and ability
    to work with huge sets of data are of primal importance, now, and will be in
    the future.
    <br /><br />
    This evidence-based business analytics course was developed by
    <a href="https://kusom.edu.np/"
      >Kathmandu University School of Management (KUSOM)</a
    >
    in collaboration with World Bank's Poverty & Equity Global Practice in
    Nepal. Nine faculty members of KUSOM participated in World Bank's 100-hour
    data literacy program in 2019 birthing a partnership between the World Bank
    and KUSOM to develop a data driven business analytics course for BBA level
    students in Nepal. Last year, KUSOM's data literacy taskforce (led by Asst.
    Professor Dipesh Karki and Asst. Professor Roshee Lamichhane Bhusal)
    conducted a needs assessment study to baseline the present data skills of
    students and understand the needs of the market, which informed the creation
    of this evidence based data curriculum. <br /><br />
    The curriculum (roughly 48 hours long) is divided into six units that covers
    topics from sourcing, analyzing and visualizing data to converting data
    insights into decisions. It integrates materials from
    <a href="https://dataliteracy.github.io/"
      >the World Bank's 100-hour data literacy workshop</a
    >
    and has been customized to meet the needs and skillset of the students. The
    syllabus has been reviewed and cleared by the University's academic council
    and will be offered to the BBA students starting Fall 2020. <br /><br />
    This syllabus has been published under the open source
    <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC.4.0 license</a> to
    foster open data culture, knowledge sharing, and collaboration. All are
    encouraged to explore the website and the syllabus and should feel free to
    adapt the syllabus to better fit their own needs. This website also features
    some data-driven articles and research by the students and faculty of KUSOM.
