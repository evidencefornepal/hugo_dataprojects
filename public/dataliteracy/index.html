        Nepal is undergoing a historic transition toward a federal nation,
        bringing decision making closer to people and providing an opportunity
        for the government to improve its service delivery. Amidst the
        transition, data literacy can support Nepal Government’s priorities by
        fostering an environment where citizens have the knowledge to use data
        for evidence-based decision making. It can lead to innovative solutions
        that promote economic growth and improve living conditions of people.
        <br /><br />
        Bearing this in mind, Nepal Data Literacy Program is designed to
        catalyze stronger data driven decision-making by government and
        non-government actors through targeted data literacy workshops. The
        program comprises a 100-hour modular, customizable pedagogy develop
        technical skills and enhance a ‘culture of data use’ among Nepalis.
        <br /><br />
        The program comprises of a three-phased course module, each of the phase
        designed to engage the participants and cater to their needs/interest
        while delving into specific data analysis and visualization tools.

        World Bank, in collaboration with
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/dfid-nepal"
          >DFID Nepal</a
        >, launched the Nepal Data Literacy program in mid-2019. First of its
        kind, the three-phased 100-hour program trained over 80 mid-career
        professionals from diverse backgrounds-- academia, civil society,
        private sector, media and international organizations-- to proactively
        engage in evidence-based policymaking and contribute in building
        stronger institutions. The program focused on both producers and
        consumers of data, making it possible to engage a cross-section of
        decision-makers, emphasize their role and utility of data-driven
        decision-making at national and sub-national level in Nepal.
        <br /><br />
        The program equipped and empowered the participants with various data
        analysis and visualization tools along with leadership development and
        design thinking concepts.

        Program Impact
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end, graduates of the Nepal Data Literacy Program had harnessed
        an aptitude to first, make better data-driven decisions in their
        everyday life and then, ‘pay it forward’ by transferring the acquired
        knowledge and skills to others in their network through trainings and
        workshops. Within the first five months of the program, the participants
        had trained over 100 people within their communities or organizations.
        <br /><br />
        All the resources and toolkits used during the program is published in
        an open source
        <a href="https://dataliteracy.github.io/" target="_blank"
          >Data Literacy portal</a
        >
        to help users develop their data skills.With over 28,000 global reach
        within six months of launch, the content developed and published on the
        Data Literacy portal have been used freely and seamlessly both within
        and outside of Nepal. <br /><br />
        Following the completion of the program, Kathmandu University School of
        Management (KUSOM) is partnering with Nepal Data Literacy Program to
        incorporate data-literacy toolkits in their BBA and MBA program and
        develop a data-driven course, freely and openly available to other
        institutions and thousands of students. Similarly, British College in
        Nepal has incorporated components of Nepal Data Literacy Program in its
        existing courses. Altogether, over the next three years, over 1,400
        undergraduate and graduate students are expected to be data literate as
        a result of Nepal Data Literacy Program.
        <br /><br />Furthermore, to integrate data literacy with education,
        KUSOM is organizing a training for teachers from outside of Kathmandu
        valley and working with them to transfer knowledge and skills to their
        respective schools and communities.
